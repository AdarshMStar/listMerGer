# listMerGer
takes two text files as input and merges the text files with unique values only.

Requirement: GCC should be installed before compiling the c++ code.

Step 1:
$ git clone https://github.com/AdarshMStar/listMerGer.git


Step 2:
$ cd listMerGer

Step 3:
$ g++ listMerGer.cpp

Step 4:
$ ./a.out

PS:For convenience keep both the text files in this directory only.


Further -- You can rename the a.out file and store it in the $PATH variable location so that you can access the tool from 
any location.
